specification created to standardize Javascript.
The Sixth Edition, initially known as ECMAScript 6 and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015,
adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, iterators and for/of loops, generators, arrow functions, binary data, typed arrays, collections ( maps, sets and weak maps), promises,number and math enhancements, reflection and proxies.
