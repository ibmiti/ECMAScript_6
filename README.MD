<!-- ECMAScript(ES) is a scripting language
specification created to standardize Javascript.
The Sixth Edition, initially known as ECMAScript 6 and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015,
adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, iterators and for/of loops, generators, arrow functions, binary data, typed arrays, collections ( maps, sets and weak maps), promises,number and math enhancements, reflection and proxies.

in other words, ES6 is a superset of javascript the reason that es6 became so popular is that it introduced new conventions and OOP concepts such as classes -->


<!-- Const variables have the same scope as variables declared using let. The difference is that const variables are immutable
 - they are not allowed to be reassigned. for example, the following generates an exception.


const a = 'hello';
a = 'Bye';



const is not subject to variable hoisting too, which means that const declarations do not move to the top
of the current execution context
